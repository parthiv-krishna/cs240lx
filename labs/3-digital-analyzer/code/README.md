Code:
 - `test-gen`: a simple test generator
 - `scope`: starter code for a digital analyzer.
 - `staff-binaries` hold example binaries you can use for comparison.

What to do:
  0. You'll need to hook two pi's using pin 21 and make sure they work.
  1. Run the test binaries to see what's going on.
  2. Write scope or test-gen first and tune.
  3. Write the other.
  4. Try to get the minimal error possible.
