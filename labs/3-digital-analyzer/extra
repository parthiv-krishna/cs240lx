   - It's easy to think because we are building small things, they are
     toys.
   - However, because they are small, and you write all the code,
     you can make them do things essentially impossible on a large
     system.

     For example: any property that must be obeyed by every single line of
     code often gets combinatorially harder as you as you add more code.
     Such as security, real time guarantees, low jitter.  The fact that
     you have a tiny system makes this easy.

   - Today we'll build a digital analyzer which after you tune it should
     have around 20 nanosecond error rates.  This would be impossible
     on stock linux or macos, with any reasonable amount of effort And,
     interestingly enough, it's much faster than a $400 Salaea from last
     year (which could only do samples every 100 nanoseconds).
